# TypeScript Node.js Boilerplate

Node.js & ExpressJS applications solves an isolated range of problems common to all applications such as route management, request and response and views. The lean structure of this framework allows us to get an application up and running quickly with few lines of code, but any and all types of functionality need practically to be done by hand.

So, the ideia is create a template so I wouldn't have to start my Node.js applications completely from scratch. I have plans to make this repository more and more complete as needs arise.
